# Lab Report 3 - Week 6

Hello! Here is my Lab Report 3 - Research and Commands


**Chosen Command**

The command I have chosen is `grep `.

The `grep` command is a command-line tool that searches for a given string in a file (or multiple files) and prints all the lines that match that string.



**How does `grep` work?**

To use the `grep` command, this is the format:

`grep [options] [pattern] [file]`

*  `grep`: This is the command itself
* `options`: Grep has options that can modify its behavior. It is not necessary to include an option for grep, but I will be exploring them further in this lab report.
* `pattern`: The pattern is the text string you want to search for.
* `file`: This is the file (or files) you want to use grep on.
