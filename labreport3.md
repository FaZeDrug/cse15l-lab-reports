# Lab Report 3 - Week 6

Hello! Here is my Lab Report 3 - Research and Commands


**Chosen Command - `Grep`

The command I have chosen is:

```
grep
```

The `grep` command is a command-line tool that searches for a given string in a file (or multiple files) and prints all the lines that match that string.
