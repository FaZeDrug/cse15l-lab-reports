Hello! Here is my Lab Report 5 - Debugging (by Natasha Tran).


# Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

# EdStem Post

**What environment are you using(computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

I am using a Windows 11 laptop and I am on Visual Studio Code.

**Detail the symptom you're seeing, be specific include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also
great. Avoid saying "it doesn't work'**

When I run my bash script `bash.sh` (which I just type `$ bash bash.sh`, which compiles the `labreport5.java` and checks if it's compiling, I get this error.

Here is my `labreport5.java` file.

The error looks like the substring is IndexOutOfBounds, but the bash script says it's compiling.

What do you understand about substrings? When you call substring(x, y), x is an inclusive index and y is an exclusive index.
